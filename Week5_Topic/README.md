## **Task 3:** EXIF Metadata

Pictures can contain a lot of additional metadata as EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) Data

Download **[image2](https://github.com/ouspg/PrivacyAndSocialEngineering/blob/main/Week5_Topic/images/image2.jpg?raw=true)** and extract the following information from it
- GPS coordinates
- Device manufacturer and the model the image has been taken with
- Date and time when the image has been originally taken

Then strip the image of the above mentioned information and return the image. You can do this for example by using **Imagemagick**. The image should not contain the above mentioned information **in any form**.

For reference here is **[image1](https://github.com/ouspg/PrivacyAndSocialEngineering/blob/main/Week5_Topic/images/image1.jpg?raw=true)** that is an example of a picture where the EXIF data has been stripped
