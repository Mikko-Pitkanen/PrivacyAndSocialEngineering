## **Task 3:** Application Permissions

[Exodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/)

Applications may have permissions and trackers for data the appliation does not require to function. Such data may be used for example to profile and hook you, for research, and for monetary gain by selling to third parties, which may or may not handle it safely. 

These permissions might also be exploited by an insider attacker or an outside attacker for compromising your privacy and safety. Such are for example the permission to record audio and full network access.

[Exodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) is a privacy auditing platform for Android application. You can use Exodus to check Android applications for trackers, permissions and signing fingerprints. 

Choose 2 applications yourself to analyze with the help of Exodus, and find a third application that has obvious unnecessary dangerous permissions, such as a flaslight application accessing your contacts. 

Name your application and answer the following questions for each application.

1. How many trackers and permissions each application has?
2. How many 'dangerous' and/or 'special' permissions does each have? (Red exclamation mark)
3. Did the applications have permissions to access such data they would use or sell for monetary gain? Which permissions and trackers are these?
4. Describe two atttack vectors enabled by these permissions for each application, had an attacker gained access into the application and/or their database.
