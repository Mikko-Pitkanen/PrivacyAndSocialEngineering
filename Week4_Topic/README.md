## **Task 1:** Telemetry and data collection

Most operating systems and manufacturers collect and send telemetry and other information about your device. This information may include data such as location, time, usage times and reasons for use. 

Search online to find out what data your phone manufacturer and operating system are sending forward. Analyze your findings, write a summary and list your sources. (Maximum one A4 page)

## **Task 2:** Windows 10 Privacy Hardening

Provided with a clean virtual machine install of Windows 10. Install the utilities you want and/or need to analyze your network traffic (such as [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or [Windows Diagnostic Data Viewer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview) Keep in mind that the latter is proprietary software from microsoft). 

**Hot Tip:** You can install Windows 10 Home Edition without a Microsoft account if you do not have an internet connection. You can do this by disabling the internet connection of your VM

Get a baseline of traffic leaving your machine. By analyzing it you may find destinations for the traffic, document all these findings.

Windows has built-in settings to protect your privacy and limit what data is actually collected. Do your best to harden your machine and minimize the amount of data transmitted to microsoft or its partners. You can follow instructions and/or tools you can find online (such as [O&O ShutUp10++](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10)), but make sure you understand what you are doing. You can always wipe the installation if you happen to break something permanently.

Once you have hardened your machine, re-analyze its traffic. Document your findings and compare them to your previous results. If there are or if you have noticed that the operating system behaves differently, document your findings.

Make a detailed summary of your research, including actions taken to harden the OS and what changed in its behaviour. Do you think these trade-offs are worth the loss your data?
