# **Week 6**

## **Task 1:** Thinking on your feet

As a social engineer it is useful to quickly take notice of small details and make assumptions based on them.

Imagine you are strolling through an office space with a bunch of open workstations. You catch a glimpse of two workstations as you walk past them; **Workstation 1** and **Workstation 2**.

What kind of assumptions can you make about the users of these machines? what is their possible occupation, operating system, personality/habits they have and what programs they use? What kind of attack vectors can you identify and what other observations can you make from these snapshots?
