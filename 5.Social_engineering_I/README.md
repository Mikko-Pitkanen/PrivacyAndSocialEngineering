## **Task 2:** Social Engineering Toolkit

[The Social Engineering Toolkit](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit) (SET or SEToolkit) is an open-source penetration testing framework designed for social engineering. It is being maintained by [TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com/), a full-service Information Security consulting organization. They have created other useful tools as well, you can find these in [their GitHub](https://github.com/trustedsec).

The tool is very well documented on their "SET user manual" found on the github page, we encourage you to explore this manual when using the tool. 

### **Task 2A)** QR Code Credential Harvest

Take a look at the SET's tool QR code creation and web attack type credential harvest. In this task we create a QR code for your self hosted credential harvest page, and a poster to try and get people to scan it. ![esimerkkikuva]() **Tähän esimerkki posteri "löydät meidät myös twitteristä"**

In this example we have a twitter login page for the credential harvest and after entering your credentials it redirects you to a *company* page.

You do not have to publicly host the site, it is enough if you can test it with the pc and phone in same network

### **Task 2B)** Tool Walkthrough

Pick a tool or a set of tools within SET and create a walkthrough for an attack using them and provide atleast one plausible use case for it.

You should include atleast one screenshot or videos for this.

## **Task 3:** Security Questions

Security questions are still often used to confirm your identity in online services

Work with this **Account recovery chatbot** and try to reset the password of a long lost account called **PewDie** that may have once belonged to the internet personality **Felix Kjellberg**

When you are successful, download the conversation in JSON format and return it
