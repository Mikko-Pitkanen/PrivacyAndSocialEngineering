# **Week 1: Regulation and privacy on the web** 

The GDPR regulation entered into force on 24 May 2016 and applies since 25 May 2018.
Since then, data collection of the companies has been restricted and consumer rights have been expanded.
The usage, processing, and storage of personally identifiable information (PII) (information about an identifiable, living person) was limited for companies operating in European Union.

Exercises this week go through some practical examples of why the regulation exists and what it means in practice.
The focus is on browser-based internet use.

## **Task 1:** GDPR Data Request

But now, companies are obligated to provide the information they have collected about you, and this will be your first task.

Create a GDPR-compliant data access request from a company of your choice. We recommend you choose a company you know holds data on you.
The response may take some time, according to [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-of-access/) this **shouldn't** take more than a month from them receiving the request, however, it might take longer than this depending on the company and your request.
Therefore it is better to do it as soon as possible after starting the course.

Read at least [GDPR Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) before crafting your request.

You may use prewritten templates, however, you should make sure the template used requests all of your data.

You can return to this assignment once you have received your information, but you should make the request as soon as possible.

After receiving the answer to your data request answer the following questions. Keep your answers concise, focused and **at most** 200 words.

1. Which company did you choose to request your data from and how long did it take to submit that information?
2. In what format did you receive your data and how many pages of it were there?
3. What kind of information was there that you had not directly given yourself? 
4. Did you understand the meaning of the information?
5. Do you think that the company collected the least amount of data required to provide the service you needed? 
6. Were you surprised about something, what?

## **Task 2:** Cookie Raid

Cookie banners are known phenomenon since GDPR entered into force.
Essentially, cookies are more or less persistent way to store user and website specific data.

[Old School Runescape Landing Page](https://oldschool.runescape.com/)

Let's look at the information about cookies on the Old School Runescape landing page. When you enter the page, you should be prompted to give your consent to the use of cookies. If this is not the case, you may have visited the site before or you may have already given your consent to bulk cookie tracking on another site that uses Cookiebot as its cookie manager. You can see the prompt again if you open the page in a new safe search page, such as Incognito in Chrome or Private Search in Safari and Firefox. Use the *Details* tab to answer the following questions:

* How many necessary cookies are there? 
* What happens if you try to disable necessary cookies? 
* List at least 7 different expiry times from the necessary cookies 
* List 3 different cookie types from necessary cookies 
* In Statistics, what is the expiry time and cookie type of **JXWEBUID** 
* In Statistics and Marketing, what other Apps or Companies are listed, other than Jagex

## **Task 3:** Browser Fingerprinting

[EFF Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)

Run the test made by EFF. After running the test you will see a score for ‘Bits of identifying information’. Below each score you will see how many users on X amount of devices are running the same setup. The rarer your setup is the more uniquely identifiable you are. Return two categories and results where you had the highest and lowest amount of identifying bits of information.

**(Ignore the AD BLOCKER USED section, as it appears to not work correctly, giving a -0.0 score)**

Why does identifiability matter? 

What pros and cons can you think of to being unique vs common?

[AmIUnique](https://amiunique.org/)

View your browser fingerprint with Am I Unique. **Canvas elements** are created by taking features from your device and browser. These features are used to generate a picture that represents your browsing setup. Return the similarity percentages of your Canvas and, if your browser supports it, WebGL Data Attributes.

What is your Screen width and Screen height similarity percentage? You may or may not have a common screen resolution in use. However people use User Interfaces and Taskbars of different sizes. Now check out the similarity percentage for Screen available width and Screen available height. Can you explain your result?

Return similarity percentage for:
- Canvas + WebGL Data
- Screen width, Screen height
- Screen available width, Screen available height
