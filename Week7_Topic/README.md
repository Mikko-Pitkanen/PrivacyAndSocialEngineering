# **Week 7** 

## **Task 1:** Social Engineering via Email

The most common attack vectors include Social Engineering via e-mail, this includes most types of phishing and more general identity faking. Since e-mail is such a popular attack vector, most email providers use spam filtering and detection systems to catch these e-mails and keep your inbox clean, while making it harder for you to click on fraudulent emails.

Your task is to write a credible and believable spear phishing e-mail to your pair that can pass through these detections. Be creative with your your email, but try to include atleast one link that the target can click on.

Before sending the email, test the email with at least one detection tool of your choice. 

Example tools: 

[MailGenius](https://www.mailgenius.com/) 

[Spamscanner](https://github.com/spamscanner/spamscanner) 

[Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) 

You are to review the email sent to you and grade it on a scale of 0-5. Write your name at the end of the review and send it as a response to the original email.

For grading return the email you sent, tester used with any possible output as well as your peer's review.
