##  **Task 1:** Reflecting privacy, OSINT, pretexing and impersonating

During the course, we have handled the 

## **Task 2:** Thinking on your feet

As a social engineer it is useful to quickly take notice of small details and make assumptions based on them.

Imagine you are strolling through an office space with a bunch of open workstations. You catch a glimpse of two workstations as you walk past them; **Workstation 1** and **Workstation 2**.

What kind of assumptions can you make about the users of these machines? what is their possible occupation, operating system, personality/habits they have and what programs they use? What kind of attack vectors can you identify and what other observations can you make from these snapshots?

## **Task 2:** Social Engineering via Email

The most common attack vectors include Social Engineering via e-mail, this includes most types of phishing and more general identity faking. Since e-mail is such a popular attack vector, most email providers use spam filtering and detection systems to catch these e-mails and keep your inbox clean, while making it harder for you to click on fraudulent emails.

Your task is to write a credible and believable spear phishing e-mail to your pair that can pass through these detections. Be creative with your your email, but try to include atleast one link that the target can click on.

Before sending the email, test the email with at least one detection tool of your choice. 

Example tools (you are free to use others as you please): 

[MailGenius](https://www.mailgenius.com/) 

[Spamscanner](https://github.com/spamscanner/spamscanner) 

[Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) 

You are to review the email sent to you and grade it on a scale of 0-5. Write your name at the end of the review and send it as a response to the original email.

For grading return the email you sent, tester used with any possible output as well as your peer's review.

## **Task 3:** Social Engineering on the Phone

Phones have been steadily topping the scam lists in English-speaking countries for some time now. More often than not, the phone scams are social engineering, with the bad actors posing as another person or a corporate entity. 

In the security side of things, social engineering on the phone more often is Vishing; Voice Phishing. The bad actors are using social engineering to make their targets **want** to do, whatever the bad actors want. The goal of Vishing is to gain access to valuable and/or protected information, helping them compromise the target.

Examine following Vishing transcripts targeted at both companies and individuals.

**Money Laundering** 

Call to the founder(Matti Meikäläinen) of a Finnish company carrying out accounting tasks on behalf of external contractors.

> *Founder (F)* : Founder speaking

> *Caller (C)* : Hello this is Meikälainen Maija from the Finnish Regional State Administrative Agency, you might know us as AVI or as Aluehallintovirasto. 
> I was trying to reach Meikäläinen Matti. Did we have the right number on register?

> *(F)* : Yes, Hello Maija, this is Matti.

> *(C)* : Wonderful.. I am calling you for the Anti-money laundering registration. As you might know, registration for anti-money laundering became obligatory in 2019. 
> Due to Covid restraints, we've had some difficulties handling the applications. Do you remember filling the registration form?

> *(F)* : Uhh.. I think so, is there something wrong with my form?

> *(C)* : Oh goodness, no! Our IT-system requires us to call and confirm the identities for each company. This is done to have a record of the people possibly coming in contact with laundered money. Unfortunately there is quite the amount of small businesses used to circulate laundered money. 
> Is there any other personnel handling transactions within your company?

> *(F)* : Alright, that is important I guess. We have only one other person who handles payments; our own accounting manager Miina Meikäläinen.

> *(C)* : Fantastic, nice to see businesses have only one accounting manager. I will be contacting her as well, could you provide me with her contact information? 

> *(F)* : Ah yes. You can contact her at *email@companyemail.com* and her phone number is **********.

> *(C)* : Right that was *email@companyemail.com* and *********'? 

> *(F)* : Correct.

> *(C)* : And would you like us to send the confirmation email to your personal or company email?

> *(F)* : Company email please. *founder@companyemail.com*. Thank you very much.

> *(C)* : Great, thank you for being so helpful. The email has the confirmation link, just follow that to confirm we contacted you and that's it!

> *(F)* : Thank you, that seems simple enough! Will I be hearing from you after contacting Miina?

> *(C)* : Hopefully not, if everything goes smoothly your registration is complete after her information is on the record.

> *(F)* : Ah right. Well thank you for contacting me so swiftly, and have a nice day.

> *(C)* : You too sir, have a nice day.
